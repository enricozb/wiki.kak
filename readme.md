Organize your life and find things quickly.

Main features:
- refer to other markdown files on your filesystem
- navigate quickly through links in a file
- format all links as relative links to remove clutter

> Note: This installs a custom markdown highlighter that is potentially
> incomplete. Please raise an issue if you do not want this behavior.
